# chat-application
This application is a simple multithreaded chat application in Java.

There is still a lot of work to do, it doesn't validate most inputs, some features are half implemented, it writes unhelpful error messages, and it gives you a plethora of errors if someone closes thier client without the !exit command, but it's a work in progress!
